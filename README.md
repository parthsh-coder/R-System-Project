R Systems Frontend Clone

ðŸŒŸ Project Overview
This repository contains the frontend code for a clone of the R Systems website landing page, as featured in the screenshot. It is a single-page application built entirely with React and is designed to be fully responsive across different devices.

The design features a prominent visual of a suspension bridge (similar to the Golden Gate Bridge) overlaid with key marketing text and a navigation bar.

Key Features:
Single-Page Application (SPA): Built from the ground up using React.

Fully Responsive: Optimized for viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

Modern UI: A sleek, dark-themed design with clear calls to action.

Navigation: Implements a dynamic header with common links like Investors, What We Do, Our Insights, etc.
